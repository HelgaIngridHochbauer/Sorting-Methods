# Sorting Algorithms Comparison Project

## Overview
This project provides a comparison of various sorting algorithms. The implementation includes a LaTeX table showcasing the performance of different sorting algorithms. Additionally, each sorting algorithm is implemented separately for clearer understanding and testing purposes.

## Instructions for Testing
To test the program, run one of the sorting algorithm implementations provided in this repository. Each implementation file contains a specific sorting algorithm that can be executed independently.

## Sorting Algorithms Included
1.**Insertion Sort**
2.**Selection Sort**
3.**Bubble Sort**
4. **Heap Sort**
5. **Merge Sort**
6. **Quick Sort**
7. **Radix Sort**

## Key Findings
   - Bubble sort becomes inefficient with larger datasets compared to other iterative sorting algorithms.
   - Heap sort is a good choice for small sets of data due to its efficiency in such cases.
   - For larger arrays, Insertion sort and the "Divide and Conquer" Quick Sort algorithm are more advisable.
   
## Conclusion
Depending on the particularities of the array, each sorting method has its usefulness. Overall, when choosing a sorting method, it is crucial to consider the nature and size of the data to be sorted.
